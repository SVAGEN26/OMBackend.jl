module OMBackend
# Load Plots (and through it Glib's gettext runtime) BEFORE any include that pulls
# in OMRuntimeExternalC. On Windows, OMRuntimeExternalC loads its own bundled
# libintl-8.dll/libiconv-2.dll into the process; if that happens first, Glib's
# libgio-2.0-0.dll later binds against the older gettext and fails to load with
# "the specified procedure could not be found". Loading Plots first makes Glib's
# gettext win the libintl-8.dll name, which OMRuntimeExternalC tolerates.
