#= Warm the shared MTK + OrdinaryDiffEq method instances that every generated
   model module invokes at build/solve time (structural_simplify, the init-solve
   ODEProblem, and the Rodas5/FBDF mass-matrix solve). The per-model module is
   eval'd after package load and cannot be cached into the image; these shared
   callees can, which is where the first-call latency actually lives.

   The DirectRHS workload below is the load-bearing one: because type erasure
   makes every DirectRHS problem share one concrete `ODEProblem` type (the
   runtime-generated RHS/jac are hidden behind FunctionWrappers), `solve` on that
   type is a single specialization that can be baked into the package image here.
   A real model that produces the same erased type then reuses it from its first
   solve in a fresh session — paid once at build, not once per model. =#
